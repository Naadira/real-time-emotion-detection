## REAL TIME EMOTION DETECTION USING DNN
Real-time Emotion Detection using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is a groundbreaking application of artificial intelligence that aims to recognize human emotions in real-time through analysis of facial expressions.
Emotions play a crucial role in human interaction and understanding them can lead to more effective communication and interaction with technology.

## About
The project focuses on developing a real-time emotion detection system using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The system is designed to analyze live video streams from a webcam, identify facial features, and classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise and many more in real-time.
The primary objective is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of DNNs in emotion detection, showcasing their ability to process complex facial data accurately and efficiently. By enabling real-time analysis, the system aims to bridge the gap between traditional methods and modern, automated approaches.
